          I am Yash Sehgal, a usual undergraduate student pursuing a computer science degree with a specialization in AI who is consistently evolving and learning new things nearly every day. My goal is to add as much value as I can add to other people's life. I am a Tech-Savvy, Developer and also a Designer.
          
          Talking about, What currently I am working on? There are 2 things I am focusing on right now. Firstly, An Open Source CSS Library for Web Developers(which is under-development). Secondly, My Social Presence(or growth on social media in general). Also, I am actively contributing to Open Source Projects.
          
          Exploration is something I really appreciate whether you know how to do anything or not. Just do it! In the end, you'll learn about that particular thing, and that's what I feel is an ideal way to learn new things. Just to be in the process.
          
          Also, When I am free and not working, I love to play the piano.
